%% Reading from the Counter Input Channel
% This example shows how to collect data from the SensorDAQ counter input
% channel using the Support Package. By default, the counter counts edges;
% that is, the number of times the signal has changed digital states.

%% Create a Data Acqusition Toolbox session
% This line will always be the same for any Support Package function that
% uses the Session-based interface (all but digital io).
s = sdaq.createSession;

%% Add counter input to the session
% This line adds the counter input (pin 7 on the terminal block) to the
% session.
sdaq.addCounter(s);

%% Get one sample of data and display it
% The first line retrieves one sample of counter data from the device and
% stores it in data. The second line tells MATLAB to display the data.
data = s.inputSingleScan;
data %#ok<NOPTS>
%%
% Note that data is 0 because no state changes were recorded in the short
% amount of time the counter was measuring data.

%% Clean up
% Deleting the session object prevents it from interfering with other
% session objects. Always do this when you're done with the channel
% (including from within a script or function). This will prevent odd
% errors elsewhere.
delete(s);
%%
% Note that if you're planning on acquiring multiple samples in one
% session, you don't have to delete the session until you're done. In fact,
% it's much faster to not have to create a new session every time you want
% data.
